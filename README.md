# Baringo_vulnerability_mitigation
This pipeline allows to replicate the data analysis for the paper "Climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the Kenyan Rift Valley: the case of Baringo and Bogoria lakes"

The code does the following:

1) Process elevation data and include it in the sublocation-level dataset
2) Process household level data and include it in the sublocation-level
3) Process roads density data and include it in the sublocation-level 
4) Implement the TOPSIS algorithm for computing the social vulnerability index 
5) Cost effectiveness analysis (1): Process data concerning the cost of interventions (workshops, plantations, embankment). 
6) Cost effectiveness analysis (2): Process data concerning the benefits of interventions (number of dwellings and agrarian jobs by sublocation).
7) Computation of CEA ratio
